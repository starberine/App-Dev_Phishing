  fishDescription: Lapu-Lapu is a part of the groupers group. Groupers are marine
    ray-finned fish in the family Epinephelidae, in the order Perciformes. Groupers
    were long considered a subfamily of the seabasses in Serranidae, but are now
    treated as distinct. Not all members of this family are called "groupers".
